Hi, my name is Taiwo. I am a member of the **awaiting DecDev SQ005** and hope to resuume the moment this Covid-19 lockdown is over. 

I will be expose to __Javascript__ with some web design tools like *Cascading Style Sheet* and *Hypertext Markup Language*. 

Other languages I am opening to be expose to during the course are __php, java, oracle, C#, react, Vue__ among other. 

_I eagerly anticipate it!_.
